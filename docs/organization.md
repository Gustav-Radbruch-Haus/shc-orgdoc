# Organization

The organization is established by the following structural elements:

- Roles: defined by a purpose and accountabilities and is assigned to persons
- Teams: defined by a purpose and accountabilities and is part of the structure

## Roles

**Definition: Roles...**
- have a purpose, that defines the reason for the existence of the role without mentioning it’s accountabilities. For example: The key master’s purpose is to ensure the distribution and overview of the keys of the SHC.
- have defined accountabilities, that define their responsibility but as well the authority of the role. For example: the Facilitator organizes the meeting, but has also the authority to cancel it due to clear reasons.

Every voted member of the SHC can have multiple roles but has to have at least one to be part of the SHC.
If a member of the SHC does not have a role, the person loses the membership.
Roles have to be assigned in the very first meeting of the SHC but can change and switched to fulfil the SHCs purpose. The assignment can change and switched to fulfil the SHCs purpose. Roles **in a project** can be assigned to persons outside of the SHC, as long as the SHC trusts these persons.
Roles can be assigned to persons outside of the SHC, as long as the SHC trusts these persons.
There is no limit of assigned roles to one person, but the person has to be aware that the person takes all responsibility that comes in sum with all roles.

## Teams

**Definition: Teams have...**
- a purpose, that defines the reason for the existence without mentioning it’s accountabilities. For example: The purpose of the Digital Services team is to empower the SHC with digital tools that lead to a greater efficacy.
- accountabilities, that define their responsibility but as well the authority. For example: the Digital Services team administrates the web server of the SHC, but has the authority to change it's configuration and even the host to ensure it will serve it's purpose and it's accountabilities.

The SHC is itself a team. To create a team, a team has to fulfil the necessary definition. Teams have the authority to create and assign roles inside the team to get autonomous adaptability without dependencies (as long as domains of existing roles aren’t violated).
Every team can have a sub-team. For example: the SHC has the sub-team Digital Services. The Digital Services team has the sub-team Website Developers.

Every team has a Team Lead role that represent the team. Team Leads are official representatives and should be presented via self presentation in the hallway in front of the SHC bureau.
