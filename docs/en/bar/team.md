Bar AG consists of three bar heads of which at least one must be a member of the SHC. In addition, there are bar members who form the team and work voluntarily in the bar as barkeepers.

# FAQ

## Can I become a member of the bar team?
Yes, every inhabitant of the house can become a member of the Bar AG. 

## Are there requirements for bar members?
Only reliability, resilience and noise resistance are required. Sometimes it gets very loud and full. Just come by and have a look. Once you've been there a few times for a rehearsal and got to know the procedures, you'll be accepted as a bar member.

## Can I become a bar-head?
Yes and no. There are always exactly 3 bar heads to avoid stalemate situations. These bar heads have been in the team a little longer and have the responsibility. When a seat becomes available, they look for a bar member who has the desire, time and ambitions to take this position. If you distinguish yourself from the bar-heads, you will be asked by the bar-management if they want to take over the position and afterwards confirmed by the bar-management as a new bar-head.
